# Givememovies

Give me movies is a website that uses AI, more specifically Natural Language Processing, to suggest movies to users using prompts, according to 4 different criteria: Genre, Actor, Director, and Maximum watchtime. Try typing something like "I want to watch a rom-com which is less than 2 hours long and with Tom Hanks in it" in the box!
